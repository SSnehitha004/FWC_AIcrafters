# #Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Deep Learning and Synthetic Data Generation
#Project Overview
Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide, with millions of women being diagnosed every year. Early detection plays a critical role in improving survival rates, and mammography is one of the most effective screening tools available. However, identifying subtle abnormalities in mammogram images can be challenging due to the complexity and variability in breast tissue appearances.
